# Lost Ark

Note: naming may not match the EU/NA launch, so "legacy" may not be "legacy" but instead "roster". Same may apply to every other term as well.

## Leveling up

- Level cap 50 (at T1 content)
- At level 30, main quest icon changes to blue one. One will be leaving East Luterra and next stop is Tortoyk
- Focus on server-wide content, stronghold and life-skills as they will benefit all characters and not just the first one
- Health potions: all nice to have at endgame, especially those with "heal %" effect so save them
- Bombs: all nice at endgame so save them
- There are hidden zones not visible in minimap but can be found by exploring
- First pet available after first dungeon. Pet loots stuff for you so you don't have to
- Skill potions around the world, behind collectibles etc. that give more skill points for use than just leveling up characters
- Island stronghold development helps in the long run, first resources needed are wood and iron
   - Craft potions/bombs/gear in stronghold
   - Basically way to save gold
- Leveling life skills (fishing etc.) helps in the long run
- PVP unlocks lvl 26 at Luterra Castle, rewards (supposedly) start dropping at lvl 30.

- Field bosses: around the world a large boss with loot, everyone can participate who happens around, loot once per day
- Una's tasks: daily and weekly quests with great rewards, main way to get gold
   - On your main character, it is recommended to do the ones that give Leap Stones or Fragments.

   - Creating alt(s) straightaway will get those modifiers up and running from day 1
- Gear can be upgraded from 0 to 20 with materials from chaos dungeons and guardian raids
   - For next set of gear, one needs to have lvl 15 gear. No need to upgrade further

## Characters and classes

- One must choose a server to play on
   - Characters and other progress cannot be moved between servers except during "server transfer" windows and it costs around 20â‚¬
   - All characters on server will share server-wide content so not really feasible to play on multiple servers
   - One can only play with other players on that same server
- Main isn't really a thing yet in T1 (or T2) content, only around T3 (these are like expansions) so switching "main" is completely possible
- PVE Tier List: https://youtu.be/iBoxLmNKUBo
- PVP Tier Lists: https://youtu.be/jg2Y50iQCds & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3kAfyocM4s&start=809
- Two build slots that can each can be freely whenever changed
   - Typically one for mobbing (a lot of small enemies) and one for bosses
   - When leveling, often useful to have one for soloing and one for grouping
   - Supports may have the mold and create support build and solo build
   - PVP has their own builds so no need to dedicate slot for them
   - More can be purchased
- Two different types of leveling: character leveling and legacy system
   - Character leveling is experience and levels that the single character has gained
   - Legacy system is account wide leveling experience that all characters on same server share and gain the benefits
- Around lvl 30ish, Trision has a training ground with all available skills to character to test out builds
