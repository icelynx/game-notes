## General tips

- Aside from level, theres
- Health potions: all nice to have at endgame, especially those with "heal %" effect
- Bombs: all nice at endgame
- Skill modifiers
   - Back attack (directly from behind): 5% bonus damage, 10% bonus chance to crit
   - Head shot (directly from front): 20% bonus damage, 10% bonus stagger damage
   - Stagger (bar under boss health bar): when depleted, boss is stunned for few seconds
   - CounterAttack: Attack directly from front stuns boss for few seconds
   - Destruction: Break shields (red glow) some bosses apply to do more damage
- Skill potions around the world, behind collectibles etc. that give more skill points for use than just leveling up characters
- 21:9 can be forced, shows more of the world (on left and right obviously)
- Expanded minimap can be moved with middle mouse button and alt + left click can be used on waypoints in it
- Island stronghold development helps in the long run, first resources needed are wood and iron
   - Craft potions/bombs/gear in stronghold
   - Basically way to save gold
- Leveling life skills (fishing etc.) helps in the long run
- Combat effects from other players can be turned off (gradually)

- Ping: ctrl + left click, holding allows to specify type of ping
- Song of escape: teleport out of any kind of instanced conten
- First pet available after first dungeon. Pet loots stuff for you so you don't have to
- Glow around character can be added from menu to more easily see self
- There are hidden zones not visible in minimap but can be found by exploring
- Daily/weekly missions that are limited to character so having multiple characters makes it possible to do them multiple times

## Characters and classes

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UjYdMoNWzA&start=1771
- Main isn't really a thing yet in T1 (or T2) content, only around T3 (these are like expansions) so switching "main" is completely possible
- Two build slots that can each can be freely whenever changed
   - Typically one for mobbing (a lot of small enemies) and one for bosses
   - When leveling, often useful to have one for soloing and one for grouping
   - Supports may have the mold and create support build and solo build
   - PVP has their own builds so no need to dedicate slot for them
   - More can be purchased
- Two different types of leveling: character leveling and legacy system
   - Character leveling is experience and levels that the single character has gained
   - Legacy system is account wide leveling experience that all characters on same server share and gain the benefits
- Around lvl 30ish, Trision has a training ground with all available skills to character to test out builds
