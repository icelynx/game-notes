## Tiers

Lost Ark has content in so called "tiers": Tier 1 (T1), Tier 2 (T2) and Tier 3 (T3). T1 content is the base game, T2 first expansion and T3 the latest expansion. Need for upgrade materials (read: grind) goes up with each tier of content, as does the difficulty. EU/NA is getting full T1 and T2 content and partially T3 content at launch.

## Leveling up

- Max level capped at 60
   - Leveling hits a wall at 50, last 10 levels will take a long time
   - Endgame opens at level 50
   - First Awakening quest line starts at 50 (class specific unique skills)
- Besides character level there's "item level" that tells how good character's gear is. This is the main limiter for endgame content.
- At level 30, main quest icon changes to blue one. One will be leaving East Luterra and next stop is Tortoyk
- Focus on server-wide content, stronghold and life-skills as they will benefit all characters and not just the first one
- Health potions: all nice to have at endgame, especially those with "heal %" effect so save them
   - If need be, use regenerative potions (harder dungeons etc. might need them)
- Bombs: all nice at endgame so save them
- There are hidden zones not visible in minimap but can be found by exploring
- First pet available after first dungeon. Pet loots stuff for you so you don't have to
- Skill potions around the world, behind collectibles etc. that give more skill points for use than just leveling up characters
- Island stronghold development helps in the long run, first resources needed are wood and iron
   - Craft potions/bombs/gear in stronghold
   - Basically way to save gold
- Leveling life skills (fishing etc.) helps in the long run
- PVP unlocks lvl 26 at Luterra Castle, rewards (supposedly) start dropping at lvl 30.
- To reach level 50 as soon as possible, completely focus on main quest with some side quests done near level 45
- There's also account level that's not tied to a character but instead all characters level up. Gives rewards

## Endgame

- Chaos dungeons: mob waves + bosses, solo or group, quick, twice per day per character for all the rewards
- Guardian raids: small area with a large monster and a timer, can be done as group or solo, twice per day per character for all the rewards
- Abyssal dungeons: trash mobs + 2 bosses, once per week per dungeon per character, group content
   - rewards dungeon armors that give set bonuses
- Classic MMO raids: requires 8 players, mechanics heavy (a lot of trial and error)
- Cube dungeons: access only with a ticket, solo or group, requires a lot of coordination and not forgiving
- Trial paths: access only with a ticket, boss rush dungeon, solo or group content
- Towers: solo content, many floors with different challenges
- Chaos gates: 4 times a week, once per hour, limited participants. Rewards once per day. Get in, find commander and kill them. Opens treasure dungeon for group.
- Ghost ships: similar to chaos gates but on sea and without treasure dungeon. Get in with a group if possible
- Field bosses: around the world a large boss with loot, everyone can participate who happens around, loot once per day
- Una's tasks: daily and weekly quests with great rewards, main way to get gold
   - On your main character, it is recommended to do the ones that give Leap Stones or Fragments.
- Adventure Islands with varying content depending on island, all are not always available
- Collectibles (generally server wide so for all characters)
   - Island tokens: gives upgrade materials
   - Giant hearts: quests, rewards, towers, npcs, etc.
   - Mokoko seeds: scattered and hidden around arkesia
   - World tree leaves: do lifeskills to get these, enhance lifeskills
   - Masterpieces: adventure book, towers, etc.
   - Ignea's tokens: adventure book
   - Sea bounties: quests, rewards, towers, npcs, etc.
- Cards: long-term progression system: completing decks give out bonuses (server-wide system)
- Rapport actions: 5 songs + 5 emotes daily that can be done to specific NPCs to gain rapport for rewards

- Rest gauge: 0 to 100 rest gauge, every day increases gauge by 10, doing chaos dungeon or guardian raid uses 20 gauge to get double rewards
   - Creating alt(s) straightaway will get those modifiers up and running from day 1
- Gear can be upgraded from 0 to 20 with materials from chaos dungeons and guardian raids
   - For next set of gear, one needs to have lvl 15 gear. No need to upgrade further

## PVP

- Use 21:9 aspect ratio for advantage
- FOV is different for teams, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGvFIZnIslQ

## Characters and classes

- One must choose a server to play on
   - Characters and other progress cannot be moved between servers except during "server transfer" windows and it costs around 20â‚¬
   - All characters on server will share server-wide content so not really feasible to play on multiple servers
   - All instanced content like dungeons, pvp, raids, auction house, etc. are cross-server so the server one is on doesn't matter
   - All non-instanced content content like adventure quests, islands, world bosses, etc. are limited to the server one is on
   - One can only play with other players on that same server
- For T1 and T2 content, Main characters aren't really a thing so one is free to explore different characters. Going into T3 content, the materials required to be competitive get so hard to get that people typically start maining a character
